Project Subject: Improvements to the Timpanogos Emergancy Response Team Website

Project Description: Add new pages and materials to the Timpanogos Emergency Response Team (TERT). The first will be a weather page. This Page will leverage the API interface from the NOAA weather service. NOAA allows for very precise weather reporting. TERT positions teams at the Aspen Grove and Timpooneke trailheads, as well as Stewart Falls, Emerald Lake, and often sends teams to Timp summit. The weather page will default to an icon and temperature for all of these locations. It will also allow for a filter that selects a location and gives more details, including a 3-day forecast. The page will display the forecast in cards, which can then be shared to social media.

A second new page will be part of an ongoing initiative for TERT members. TERT has a number of training videos. This page will display all the videos, but have options to narrow down the display based on subject. A future initiative will allow us to track who has watched the videos, which may influence who is allowed to help out at certain stations. For now, I'm thinking of just adding a form with basic details (name) and checkboxes for videos watched. I'd like to output the submission to a JSON file.

Project Reason and Purpose: TERT volunteers help provide medical assistance, education, and communications on Mount Timpanogos. Our members are excepted to have certain training and meet certain levels of competency. One of my roles with the team is social media management. I've been looking for a better way to post weather reports to our various pages, so that the public is aware of possible conditions on the mountain. We're also trying to build out a members only section that helps with training. We have several training videos, but need a way to present them, and eventually track who has watched them.
